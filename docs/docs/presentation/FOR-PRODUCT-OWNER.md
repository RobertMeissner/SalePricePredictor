## 1. The Business Problem (3 min) ‚≠ê MAIN FOCUS

### Why House Price Prediction Matters

**The stakes are high**:
- **Median US home price**: ~$190,000
- **Typical buyer/seller**: Makes 3-4 home transactions in lifetime
- **Cost of bad pricing**:
  - **Buyers**: Overpay by $20K-$50K
  - **Sellers**: Leave $20K-$50K on table
  - **Real estate agents**: Lose clients due to poor advice

### Real-World Use Cases

**Who benefits?**

1. **Home Buyers** üè†
   - "Is this $250K asking price fair?"
   - Use case: Enter address ‚Üí get predicted price ‚Üí negotiate

2. **Home Sellers** üí∞
   - "What should I list my house for?"
   - Use case: Get competitive price ‚Üí sell faster

3. **Real Estate Agents** üè¢
   - "How should I price this listing?"
   - Use case: Data-driven pricing ‚Üí close more deals

4. **Investors** üìä
   - "Which properties are undervalued?"
   - Use case: Find deals before market catches on

### Success Criteria (Business Metrics)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Prediction Accuracy** | Within $20K (¬±10%) | Competitive with Zillow, Redfin |
| **Explainability** | Top 5 factors visible | Users trust predictions they understand |
| **Response Time** | <1 second | Good user experience |
| **Coverage** | 80% of listings | Most common house types |

## 2. The Solution (2 min)

### What I Built

A **machine learning system** that predicts house prices based on:

**Objective factors** (79 total):
- **Size**: Living area, lot size, bedrooms, bathrooms
- **Quality**: Overall condition (1-10 scale), materials used
- **Location**: Neighborhood, proximity to amenities
- **Amenities**: Garage, basement, fireplace, pool
- **Age**: Year built, renovations

**Output**:
- Predicted price (e.g., "$189,000")
- Confidence interval (e.g., "¬±$19,000")
- Top 5 factors influencing price

### How It Works (Simple Explanation)

```
User Input
  ‚Üì
System analyzes 79 factors
  ‚Üì
Compares to 1,460 similar homes
  ‚Üì
Predicts price based on patterns
  ‚Üì
Returns: Price + Key Factors
```

**No ML jargon needed** - it's pattern matching at scale.

#### Screen 1: Dataset Overview (30 sec)

**Show**:
- **1,460 homes** in dataset
- **Price range**: $34,900 - $755,000
- **Average price**: $180,921
- **Typical home**: 1,500 sq ft, 3 bed, 2 bath

**What this tells stakeholders**: "We have sufficient data for reliable predictions."

---

#### Screen 2: Price Distribution (1 min)

**Show histogram**:
- Most homes: $100K-$200K (middle-class market)
- Few outliers: $500K+ (luxury market)
- Right-skewed distribution

**Business insight**: "Our model works best for typical homes ($100K-$250K), which is 80% of the market."

**Show box plot**:
- Median: $163K
- Outliers visible (luxury homes)

**Stakeholder value**: Understand market dynamics at a glance.

---

#### Screen 3: Key Factors (1.5 min)

**Interactive scatter plot** (select feature = GrLivArea):

- **X-axis**: Living area (sq ft)
- **Y-axis**: Sale price
- **Trend line**: Clear positive correlation

**Drag slider**: See different size ranges

**Business insight**: "Every 100 sq ft adds ~$7,000 to price."

**Switch to OverallQual** (quality rating 1-10):

**Business insight**: "Jump from Quality 7‚Üí8 adds $40K to price. That's where renovations pay off."

---

#### Screen 4: Neighborhood Analysis (1 min)

**Box plot by neighborhood**:

- **Premium neighborhoods**: NorthRidge, StoneBridge (median $300K+)
- **Middle tier**: NAmes, Gilbert (median $150K-$200K)

**Use case for agents**: "Your client wants $250K? Compare their home to NorthRidge sales."

---

#### Screen 5: Correlation Heatmap (1 min)

**Show top 10 features** correlated with price:

1. OverallQual (0.79) - Quality is king
2. GrLivArea (0.71) - Size matters
3. GarageCars (0.64) - Garage capacity
4. GarageArea (0.62) - Garage size
5. TotalBsmtSF (0.61) - Basement space

**Business insight**: "Focus renovations on quality improvements and garage expansion - highest ROI."

**Surprising finding**: "Pool doesn't matter (99% of homes don't have one in Ames, Iowa)."

## 4. Results & Business Impact (3 min)

### Model Performance (Translated to Business Terms)

**Technical**: R¬≤ Score = 0.8923

**Business translation**:

> "The model explains 89% of price variance. On a $180K home, predictions are typically within **$19K** (¬±10%). This is competitive with Zillow's Zestimate."

### Accuracy by Price Range

| Price Range | Avg Error | % Error | Usability |
|-------------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| <$150K | $12K | 8% | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| $150K-$300K | $19K | 10% | ‚úÖ Good |
| $300K-$500K | $31K | 12% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Decent |
| >$500K | $68K | 18% | ‚ùå Needs work |

**Business decision**: "Focus on <$300K market (80% of homes) where we're most accurate."

---

### ROI Calculation (Hypothetical)

**Scenario**: Real estate agent uses this tool for 50 transactions/year.

**Before** (gut feel pricing):
- 20% overpriced ‚Üí 10 homes sit for 90+ days
- 10% underpriced ‚Üí 5 homes leave $15K on table
- **Cost**: Lost commissions + time waste

**After** (data-driven pricing):
- More accurate pricing ‚Üí faster sales
- **Benefit**: Close 10 extra deals/year (from faster turnarounds)
- **Value**: 10 deals √ó $5K commission = **$50K extra revenue/year**

**Cost to build**: 2-3 weeks of development time

**ROI**: Pays for itself in <1 month per agent.

### What Customers Get

**For home buyers**:
- "Is $250K fair?" ‚Üí "Model says $238K. You're overpaying by $12K."
- Negotiation leverage

**For sellers**:
- "What should I ask?" ‚Üí "Model says $210K ¬± $18K. List at $219K."
- Faster sales (priced competitively)

**For agents**:

## 8. Q&A (2 min)

Common questions:

**Q: How does this compare to Zillow?**
A: Zillow's Zestimate averages ¬±10% error. We're at ¬±10% for typical homes, so competitive. Our advantage: we can explain predictions (Zillow is black box).

**Q: What if the model is wrong?**
A: We show confidence intervals (¬±$19K) and mark low-confidence predictions. Users know when to get professional appraisal.

**Q: How much does it cost to run?**
A: Minimal - Python + open-source libraries. Cloud hosting ~$50/month for 1K predictions/day. Scales easily.

**Q: How long to add new cities?**
A: Need data (MLS listings). With data: 1-2 days to retrain, 2-3 days to validate accuracy. Total: ~1 week per city.

**Q: What about privacy?**
A: We use publicly available MLS data (already published online). No personal info collected.
