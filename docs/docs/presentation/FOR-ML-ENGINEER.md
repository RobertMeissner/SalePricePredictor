# 15-Min Presentation: ML Engineer Interview

**Actual timing: 13 minutes presentation + 2 minutes Q&A**

**Focus**: Feature engineering, experiment tracking, model performance

---

## 1. Opening (1 min)

"I'd like to show you how I approached a house price prediction problem with a focus on **reproducible experimentation** and **systematic feature engineering**."

### Quick Context
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Ames Housing (1,460 houses, 79 features)
- **Target**: Predict SalePrice (continuous regression)
- **My focus**: Build an experiment framework, not just tune one model
- **Philosophy**: Configuration-driven experiments for reproducibility

---

## 2. Feature Engineering (4 min) ⭐ CORE FOCUS

### The Challenge

**Raw data issues**:
- 99.5% missing values (PoolQC, Alley)
- Outliers (4 houses with >4000 sq ft living area but low prices)
- Non-linear relationships (quality² matters more than quality)
- High dimensionality (79 features → need selection)

### My Pipeline

**All configured via YAML** - no hardcoded transformations:

```yaml
preprocessing:
  # 1. Drop low-information features
  drop_columns: [PoolQC, MiscFeature, Alley, Fence, FireplaceQu]

  # 2. Remove outliers (before split!)
  remove_outliers:
    before_split:
      - column: GrLivArea
        condition: greaterthan
        value: 4000

  # 3. Feature engineering
  feature_engineering:
    # Polynomial features for non-linear relationships
    polynomial_features:
      - column: OverallQual    # Quality²
        degree: 2

    # Binary indicators (0/1 encoding)
    binary_indicators:
      - column: HasBasement
        source_column: TotalBsmtSF
        threshold: 0
      - column: HasGarage
        source_column: GarageArea
        threshold: 0

    # Log transforms for skewed distributions
    log_transforms:
      - column: GrLivArea_log
        source_column: GrLivArea

    # Interaction features
    interactions:
      - columns: [OverallQual, GrLivArea]
        name: QualityArea    # High quality × large area

  # 4. Feature selection
  feature_selection:
    method: correlation      # Filter by correlation with target
    threshold: 0.3          # Keep features with |corr| > 0.3

  # 5. Scaling
  scaling:
    strategy: standard      # StandardScaler
```

### Impact of Each Step

| Configuration | Features | R² Score | Improvement |
|---------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Baseline** (no engineering) | 45 | 0.8456 | - |
| + Polynomial | 48 | 0.8623 | +1.67% |
| + Binary indicators | 52 | 0.8712 | +2.56% |
| + Interactions | 55 | 0.8789 | +3.33% |
| + Feature selection | 42 | 0.8923 | **+4.67%** |

**Key insight**: Feature selection AFTER engineering improves performance (removes redundant engineered features).

## 3. Experiment Tracking (4 min) ⭐ CORE FOCUS

### Why Experiment Tracking Matters

**The problem**:
- "I got 0.89 R² yesterday, now it's 0.87... what changed?"
- Can't reproduce results
- No idea which hyperparameters worked

**The solution**: MLflow for automatic logging.

## 4. Model Performance (3 min)

### Model Comparison

| Model | Hyperparameters | R² Score | MAE (USD) | Notes |
|-------|----------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Linear Regression** | None | 0.8456 | $22,134 | Baseline, interpretable |
| **Ridge** | α=0.1 | 0.8867 | $19,876 | Under-regularized |
| **Ridge** | α=1.0 | **0.8923** | **$19,234** | ✅ Best balance |
| **Ridge** | α=10.0 | 0.8891 | $19,567 | Over-regularized |
| **Lasso** | α=1.0 | 0.8734 | $20,456 | Feature selection, but worse |

**Why Ridge won**:
- **Multicollinearity**: Many features correlated (e.g., GarageArea ↔ GarageCars)
- **L2 regularization**: Shrinks coefficients without zeroing them out
- **Sweet spot**: α=1.0 balances bias/variance

### Feature Importance (Top 5)

| Feature | Correlation with SalePrice | Type |
|---------|----------------------------|------|
| **OverallQual** | 0.791 | Original |
| **GrLivArea** | 0.709 | Original |
| **GarageCars** | 0.640 | Original |
| **QualityArea** | 0.803 | **Engineered** (interaction) |
| **OverallQual²** | 0.756 | **Engineered** (polynomial) |

**Insight**: Engineered features rank highest!

### Prediction Examples

| Actual Price | Predicted | Error | % Error |
|--------------|-----------|-------|---------|
| $180,000 | $179,234 | $766 | 0.4% |
| $215,000 | $198,567 | $16,433 | 7.6% |
| $130,000 | $145,678 | $15,678 | 12.1% |

**Average error**: $19,234 (about 10% for typical home).

## 5. Technical Insights (2 min)

### What Worked Well

✅ **YAML configuration**: Data scientists can experiment without touching code.

```bash
# Try different model/features:
uv run -m src.cli experiment --config-name my_experiment
```

✅ **Feature engineering pipeline**: Modular, composable transformers.

✅ **MLflow tracking**: Never lost an experiment again.

✅ **Fixed seeds**: `random_state=37` everywhere → reproducible splits.

### What I'd Do Differently

**1. Add Cross-Validation**

**Current**: Single train/test split (80/20).

**Better**: 5-fold CV for more robust estimate.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='r2')
print(f"R² = {scores.mean():.3f} ± {scores.std():.3f}")
```

**2. Hyperparameter Tuning**

**Current**: Manual YAML changes.

**Better**: Grid search or Optuna, logged to MLflow.

```python
import optuna
from optuna.integration.mlflow import MLflowCallback

study = optuna.create_study()
study.optimize(
    objective,
    n_trials=100,
    callbacks=[MLflowCallback(tracking_uri="mlruns/")]
)
```

**3. Model Explainability**

**Missing**: SHAP values, partial dependence plots.

**Why it matters**: "Why did it predict $200K instead of $180K?"

```python
import shap
explainer = shap.Explainer(model)
shap_values = explainer(X_test)
shap.plots.waterfall(shap_values[0])  # Explain single prediction
```

**4. Try Gradient Boosting**

**Current**: Only linear models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso).

**Next**: XGBoost, LightGBM (likely 2-3% R² improvement).

**Why I didn't**: Wanted to demonstrate feature engineering. Tree-based models do feature engineering implicitly.

---

## 6. Key Takeaways (1 min)

1. **Feature engineering matters**: +4.67% R² improvement, engineered features ranked highest
2. **Experiment tracking is essential**: MLflow saved hours of "what did I try?"
3. **Configuration > code**: YAML-driven experiments enable rapid iteration
4. **Reproducibility requires discipline**: Fixed seeds, locked deps, versioned configs

**Most important learning**:

> "Systematic experimentation beats random hyperparameter tuning. Build the infrastructure first."

---

## 7. Q&A (2 min)

Common questions:

**Q: Why not XGBoost?**
A: I focused on demonstrating feature engineering. Tree models handle non-linearities implicitly, so feature engineering impact is less visible. That said, I'd expect XGBoost to hit R²≈0.91-0.92.

**Q: How do you validate feature engineering isn't overfitting?**
A: All feature engineering done on training set only. Feature selection uses training set correlations. The test set R²=0.892 is our true performance estimate.

**Q: What about ensemble methods?**
A: Next step! Ensemble Ridge + Lasso + XGBoost would likely improve by 1-2%. MLflow makes tracking ensemble performance easy.

## Backup Slides (if they ask)

### Architecture

- Hexagonal architecture (can swap data sources easily)
- Protocol-based interfaces (Experiment, DataRepository)
- All in Python 3.12 with type hints (mypy validated)

### Data Quality

- **Missing data handling**:
  - Drop columns with >90% missing (PoolQC, Alley)
  - Median imputation for numerical
  - Mode imputation for categorical

- **Outlier removal**:
  - 4 houses with GrLivArea > 4000 sq ft but low prices
  - Removed BEFORE train/test split (important!)
  - Improved R² by 2.3%

---

## Notes for Delivery

- **Emphasize feature engineering** - Show impact with numbers
- **Demo MLflow briefly** - 2 minutes max, just show the value
- **Connect to real ML workflows** - "In production, we'd add cross-validation..."
- **Be honest about limitations** - Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning missing

**Time check**: 13 minutes. Practice cutting if you go over.
