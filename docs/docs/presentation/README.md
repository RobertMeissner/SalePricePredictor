# Tech Interview Presentation Guide

This directory contains **multiple versions** of a 15-minute tech interview presentation for the SalePricePredictor project, tailored to different audiences.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: The Original Presentation is Too Long!

**Reality check**: The original 5-section presentation (01-problem.md through 05-qa.md) contains **25-30 minutes** of content, not 15 minutes.

**Solution**: Use the **audience-specific versions** below that are **actually 15 minutes**.

## Preparation Checklist

Before your tech interview, ensure:

### Environment Setup
- [ ] MLflow has at least 2-3 logged experiments
- [ ] Streamlit dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Data files exist in `data/` directory
- [ ] All dependencies installed (`uv sync`)

### Terminal Preparation
- [ ] Open 3 terminal windows:
  1. For running experiments
  2. For MLflow UI
  3. For Streamlit dashboard
- [ ] Pre-load commands in history:
  ```bash
  make experiment
  make mlflow
  make dashboard
  make test
  ```

### Browser Tabs
- [ ] Presentation open at `http://localhost:8000`
- [ ] MLflow UI ready (but don't open until demo time)
- [ ] Have GitHub repo page ready (optional)

### Practice
- [ ] Walk through the full presentation at least once
- [ ] Practice the demo section (most critical)
- [ ] Review Q&A preparation notes
- [ ] Time yourself (aim for 12-13 minutes to leave room for questions)

## Tips for Delivery

### General
- Start with confidence: "I'd like to walk you through a project that demonstrates both ML skills and software engineering best practices."
- Use the presentation as a guide, not a script
- Engage with your audience: "Does this make sense?" "Any questions so far?"

### Problem Section
- Keep it brief - everyone understands house price prediction
- Focus on WHY you made this project (to demonstrate engineering, not just ML)

### Architecture Section
- Don't get too deep into code - focus on high-level design
- Emphasize trade-offs: "I chose X over Y because..."

### Demo Section
- This is the highlight - practice this section the most
- Have a backup plan if something fails (screenshots, video recording)
- Narrate what you're doing: "Now I'm going to run an experiment with this YAML config..."

### Results Section
- Be honest about what worked and what didn't
- Show reflection: "If I were to do this again, I would..."
- Connect to business value: "This 4% improvement could mean thousands of dollars in better pricing"

### Q&A
- Don't memorize answers - use them as reference
- If you don't know something: "I haven't worked with that specifically, but I'd approach it by..."
- Ask for clarification: "Are you asking about X or Y?"

---

## Customization

Feel free to customize the presentation for your specific interview:

- Emphasize sections relevant to the role (e.g., more architecture for senior roles, more ML for DS roles)
- Add company-specific examples: "This is similar to how I imagine [Company] handles..."
- Skip sections if short on time (can skip code walkthrough in Demo section)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Presentation won't load
```bash
# Check if mkdocs-material is installed
uv run mkdocs --version

# Rebuild site
uv run mkdocs build

# Try serving on a different port
uv run mkdocs serve -a localhost:8001
```

### MLflow UI not showing experiments
```bash
# Check MLflow directory exists
ls -la mlruns/

# Run an experiment first
make experiment

# Restart MLflow UI
make mlflow
```

### Streamlit dashboard errors
```bash
# Check data file exists
ls -la data/train.csv

# Reinstall streamlit dependencies
uv sync

# Try running directly
uv run streamlit run src/presentation/streamlit_app.py
```

## Feedback & Iteration

After your interview:

- Note which questions you received
- Add them to `05-qa.md` for future reference
- Update sections that felt rushed or unclear
- Time yourself and adjust content to fit 15 minutes better

Good luck with your tech interview! üöÄ
